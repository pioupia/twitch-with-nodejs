Twitch-with-nodejs is an open source back-end and project can send a stream of a user to a another user. In the future, the project can be able to create rooms and the streams can be private.
Like Twitch but not so good.

Using expressjs and Angular.

The project is not finished.

Things to do :
- [ ] Launch and view a stream with the new Angular structure
- [ ] Add clips
- [ ] Dark mode / light mode
- [ ] The app needs an icon
- [x] Create a chat system
- [ ] Account management system
- [ ] Video manipulation
